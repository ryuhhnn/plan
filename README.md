## Plan

Plan is an open-source event planning platform written on top of the React framework. This project is in the very early stages of development and I am open to any suggested features or enhancements. If you would like to submit a pull request, I do ask that you kindly follow the conventions used throughout the rest of the project, use your best judgement.

## Installation

Installation is pretty straightforward. Clone the repository, run "npm install", then run "webpack" in your terminal. All minified JavaScript will be outputted to <i>scripts.min.js</i>.
